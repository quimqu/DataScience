**Data Science Scripts for Various Problems**

With my experience, I am providing a collection of Jupyter notebooks, Python and R examples that solve various exercises. I will also strive to optimize the code by presenting different solutions for the models, so that you can compare the results.

Let's go over what is contained in each folder:

- ANN Classification and Regression: This folder contains a Jupyter Notebook that operates on a dataset of second-hand cars. Artificial Neural Networks are used for classifying the cars and predicting their expected selling price through regression.
- Image classification with convolutional networks: CNN are used to classify grays cale and color images from the CIFAR10 database.
- Kaggle Competitions: some coding samples of Kaggle competitions where I have been playing.
